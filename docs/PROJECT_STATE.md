# Project state

## Current phase

Phase 1B is complete on `phase1b/v2-smoke`, pending human review. No training,
catalog download, or larger data generation is authorized by this state.

## Completed

- established Vultr as the sole authoritative Git repository;
- configured dedicated key-based AutoDL access and safe sync scripts;
- created isolated AutoDL project directories under `/root/autodl-tmp/lensing-4`;
- reconciled qkzhang, wjx pair-verification and `/tmp` PDF-baseline lineages;
- traced PDF metrics to exact data/code/checkpoint evidence;
- created curated immutable source snapshots and manifests;
- classified legacy datasets and code for retain/reuse/rewrite/exclude decisions;
- documented v2-smoke scope and storage gate.
- defined the authoritative v2 physics and Fourier/Morse conventions;
- implemented and tested the SIS analytic control and general solver protocol;
- implemented fail-closed input policies and grouped split validation;
- implemented the v2 logical metadata schema, provenance, seeds, and manifests;
- accepted ADR-001 for Zarr v2 plus Parquet smoke storage;
- validated an execution-disabled 48-pair smoke specification;
- hardened EM astrometry with explicit physical image IDs;
- aligned detector-noise provenance to every selected image and detector slot;
- replaced the bare timing float with a typed uncertainty-bearing product;
- enforced complete extra-image status and primary-definition semantics;
- added zero-fill/decomposition and complete-manifest validators;
- upgraded the unmaterialized schema to `2.0.0-alpha.2`;
- passed 93 pytest cases, Ruff, mypy, package build, the prior AutoDL SIS
  contract, and the AutoDL alpha.2 metadata contract.
- merged the Phase 1A PR after its GitHub Actions check passed;
- pinned an isolated AutoDL Phase 1B scientific environment;
- numerically validated SIS, SIE+shear, and EPL+shear deterministic fixtures;
- implemented detector-time-aware IMRPhenomXPHM smoke waveform generation;
- generated and atomically published exactly 48 accepted engineering pairs;
- validated Zarr v2 arrays, Parquet records, checksums, policies, six-slot
  noise provenance, grouped IDs, and interruption/resume behavior;
- demonstrated matched-response amplitude and Morse-phase preservation at
  maximum relative errors below `2.0e-16`;
- kept all published waveform arrays on AutoDL; only small manifests and
  validation evidence are tracked by Git.

## Not started by design

- literature review;
- model or posterior training;
- GWOSC/GWTC download;
- manuscript work.

## Next recommended phase

Review `docs/reports/PHASE1B_SMOKE_REPORT.md`, the copied manifest, and failure
record. If accepted, open a separate gate for Phase 2 literature,
identifiability, and preregistration work. Do not reuse the engineering smoke
artifact as a scientific dataset.
