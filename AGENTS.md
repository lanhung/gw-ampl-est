## Mission

Develop a publication-quality framework for calibrated, model-conditional
multimessenger posterior inference of magnifications for galaxy-scale
strongly lensed gravitational-wave image pairs.

The project must be materially different from:
- deterministic SIS point regression;
- GW-only pair classification;
- short-delay overlapping-image microlensing inference;
- a neural approximation of an analytically invertible SIS formula.

## Machine architecture

The Vultr repository is the only authoritative code repository:

`/root/work/lensing-4`

Codex runs on Vultr.

The AutoDL server is a remote compute and data machine accessed through:

`ssh autodl-lensing`

The new AutoDL project root is:

`/root/autodl-tmp/lensing-4`

The resolved immutable legacy roots are:

- `/root/autodl-tmp/qkzhang`
  - authoritative source for the original 0222/0228 legacy datasets;
- `/root/autodl-tmp/wjx_project/classcify-gw-lensing-pairs-main`
  - downstream pair-classification project;
- `/root/autodl-tmp/tmp`
  - source of the PDF point-regression baseline and related later variants.

Never write, rename, move, delete, normalize in place, or overwrite files
under any legacy root.

All new code copies, generated data, caches, manifests and runs must be placed
under `/root/autodl-tmp/lensing-4`.

## Source-of-truth rules

- Edit code only in the Vultr Git repository.
- Sync code to AutoDL through `scripts/remote/sync_to_autodl.sh`.
- Treat the AutoDL repository copy as disposable.
- Do not edit source files directly on AutoDL.
- Do not commit raw strain, NPY/HDF5 datasets, GWOSC files or checkpoints.
- Store large data on AutoDL and commit only manifests, configurations,
  checksums, summaries, figures and small tabular results.

## Legacy-data decision

Existing data are not approved as the main training set or final test set.

They may be used only for:
- legacy baseline reproduction;
- SIS analytic-identity tests;
- Morse-phase and image-ordering tests;
- early smoke tests;
- comparison with old point-regression and pair-classification methods.

They must not be used to support claims about:
- real detector noise;
- H1/L1/V1 network inference;
- calibrated posterior coverage;
- multimessenger observables;
- SIE or power-law galaxy lenses;
- mass-sheet uncertainty;
- actual GWTC performance.

Do not run a full regeneration using the old generator before completing the
generator audit and approving a v2 schema.

## Current phase gate

Phase 0, Phase 1A, Phase 1A.1, Phase 1B, and the Phase 1B.1 cleanup are
complete. Phase 2 preregistration is open on `phase2/preregistration`.

The reviewed Phase 1B engineering artifact is frozen as:

`gwlens-v2-2.0.0-alpha.2-ae86beab1c132682`

Phase 2 is documentation and design only. It may cover literature,
identifiability, estimands, priors, observation models, selection effects,
splits, calibration tests, baselines, ablations, compute estimates, and the
next execution gate.

During Phase 2, do not:

- train any neural model;
- generate additional waveform pairs;
- download GWTC or GWOSC data;
- call synthetic Gaussian noise real detector noise;
- modify any legacy file;
- use the smoke dataset for scientific performance claims;
- start manuscript writing;
- proceed to medium- or large-scale generation.

No Phase 3 execution is authorized until the Phase 2 report and
preregistration receive human review.

All smoke outputs must be written only below:

`/root/autodl-tmp/lensing-4/data_v2/smoke`

The 48-pair smoke dataset is engineering-only and may never be used for
training, calibration, scientific testing, or reported performance claims.

## Scientific integrity

- Never fabricate results, citations, completed runs or calibration.
- Separate completed results from plans.
- Absolute magnification must always be described as conditional on the
  adopted lens model and electromagnetic information.
- Keep signed magnification, absolute magnification, amplitude factor,
  relative magnification, flux ratio, parity and Morse index distinct.
- Never expose latent truth variables as deployable observables.
- Maintain an explicit privileged-variable denylist.
- Treat distance-magnification and mass-sheet degeneracies as core scientific
  issues.

## Remote command safety

- Use the `autodl-lensing` SSH alias.
- Never include a password in commands, prompts, files or logs.
- Do not use `rsync --delete`.
- Do not use recursive deletion on AutoDL.
- Before a command that may create more than 10 GB, estimate storage.
- Before a job expected to exceed one hour, create a configuration, manifest,
  log path and resume strategy.
- Read large NPY arrays through headers or memmap before loading them.
- Do not calculate full checksums of hundreds of GB without first estimating
  runtime and I/O cost.

## Reproducibility

Continuously maintain:

- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- `docs/FAILURES.md`
- `docs/audits/`
- `docs/REMOTE_TOPOLOGY.md`
- `manifests/`
- `results/experiment_registry.csv`

All future datasets must record:
- generator Git commit;
- configuration hash;
- seed hierarchy;
- source, lens, image, pair and noise-segment IDs;
- waveform and lens-solver versions;
- detector labels;
- GWOSC product version where applicable;
- PSD and data-quality procedure;
- split assignment.

## Completion protocol

At the end of each phase:

1. run relevant checks;
2. update project state and decisions;
3. list completed, failed and deferred work;
4. inspect `git diff`;
5. commit with a descriptive message.

Do not proceed to the next phase until the current phase report exists.
